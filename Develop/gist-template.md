# Regex Tutorial for Matching a URL

A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from left to right. Regular expressions are used to replace text within a string, validate forms, extract a substring from a string based on a pattern match, and so much more. The term "regular expression" is a mouthful, so you will usually find the term abbreviated to "regex" or "regexp". This tutorial explains how a regex for matching a URL functions, breaking down each component of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary

This tutorial describes the regex, or sequence of characters that defines the specific search pattern of a URL, ```/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/```. The characters used in this specific search pattern are called metacharacters, which instead of indicating a literal character, indicates a more generalized pattern. Regex are frequently used to validate input, as when included in code or search algorithms, regex can be used to find certain patterns of characters in a string, or find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string.
